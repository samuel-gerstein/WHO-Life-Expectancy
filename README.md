# WHO-Life-Expectancy
Public health experts have coined the term "Social Determinants of Health" in order to understand how educational, governmental, and social institutions affect communities' overall health. This project aims to incorporate this concept with educational and economic data amongst public health information, in order to further understand the characteristics influencing a country's life expectancy. 

The features used in this dataset include immunization rates, years of schooling, economic development status, average BMI among other metrics.
